# GitHub Markdown
> Website: https://andre601.ch/GitHub-Markdown

GitHub offers Markdown formatting on various places. From your default **bold** and *italic* to some "GitHub Flavourited Markdown" can you find a lot of options.  
But since the official Markdown Guide is fairly limited and doesn't even list all features usable on GitHub, did I create this repository.

This Repository, which you can find a live-version of on the above shown URL, tries to showcase all available formatting options used in Markdown (Excluding HTML styling of course).

Found a feature not listed here? Tell me and I'll try to implement it.  
But keep in mind that it may either come with limitations, or won't be displayed at all due to certain restrictions.
