# GitHub Markdown

GitHub has a lot of formatting options with Markdown. This can be your basic formatting like **bold**, *italic* or similar.  
But there are also some formatting options that aren't documented but still available.

This website (and repository) tries to list all available options available in GitHub, so that you won't miss out on them.

If you do find a feature that isn't documented here, do not hesitate to make a Pull request for it!
