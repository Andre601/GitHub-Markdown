## Link shortening
GitHub automatically shortens/alters a list of specific URL-patterns to have it more easy to read.

### Commits
Posting a commit URL will automatically shorten it depending on some conditions.  
When the URL points to a commit in the same repo, will it be changed to the first 7 characters of the commit SHA.  
However, when the URL points to a commit of a separate repository, will the resulting text be in the form of `user/repo@ commit`

!!! tip "Pro-tip"
    You can also just provide the commit SHA in one of the following formats to link it:
    
    - `:commit` For commits within the same repository
    - `:user@:commit` For commits of User `:user`
    - `:user/:reopo@:commit` For commits of User `:user` in repo `:repo`

!!! example
    === "Markdown"
        ```
        Same repository:
        
        - https://github.com/Andre601/GitHub-Markdown/commit/97c92e943f888101026473b2168c90398d92655c
        - 97c92e943f888101026473b2168c90398d92655c

        - jlord/sheetsee.js@a5c3785ed8d6a35868bc169f07e40e889087fd2e

### Issues and Pull requests
You can link to issues and Pull requests in various ways.

!!! example
    === "Markdown"
        ```
        Full URL:
        
        - https://github.com/Andre601/GitHub-Markdown/pull/2
        - https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js/issues/26
        
        Issue/Pull request number (Own repository):
        
        - #2
        
        Issue/Pull request number (External repository):
        
        - jlord/sheetsee.js#26  
        - github/linguist#4039
        ```
        
    === "Result"
        Full URL:
        
        - [#2](https://github.com/Andre601/GitHub-Markdown/pull/2)
        - [jlord/sheetsee.js#26](https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js/issues/26)
        
        Issue/Pull request number (Own repository):
        
        - [#2](https://github.com/Andre601/GitHub-Markdown/pull/2)
        
        Issue/Pull request number (External repository):
        
        - [jlord/sheetsee.js#26](https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js/issues/26)
        - [github/linguist#4039](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/4039)

----
## File previews
When you link to a section of a file in a specific commit will GitHub show the targeted content in the Issue/Pull request.

Note, that we use an image here to display the result.

!!! example
    === "Markdown"
        ```
        https://github.com/Andre601/GitHub-Markdown/blob/97c92e943f888101026473b2168c90398d92655c/requirements.txt#L1
        ```
        
    === "Result"
        ![image](file-preview.png)

----
## Color preview
When using [inline code](../general#inline-code) can you use a hashtag, followed by a hexadecimal color value (i.e. `#ffffff`) and GitHub will automatically add a small square in the provided color to it.

!!! example
    === "Markdown"
        ```
        I like green: `#16c60c`
        ```
        
    === "Result"
        I like green: `#16c60cðŸŸ©`

----
## Advanced (task) lists
Whenever you link an issue, Pull request or Discussion in a list or Task list will GitHub automatically display the title, id and the current state of the issue, Pull request or Discussion.  
Whenever a issue or Pull request is linked in a task list and said issue/Pull request is closed or merged will the corresponding task list entry get "checked".

!!! example
    === "Markdown"
        ```
