## Link shortening
GitHub automatically shortens/alters a list of specific URL-patterns to have it more easy to read.

### Commits
Posting a commit URL will automatically shorten it depending on some conditions.  
When the URL points to a commit in the same repo, will it be changed to the first 7 characters of the commit SHA.  
However, when the URL points to a commit of a separate repository, will the resulting text be in the form of `user/repo@ commit`

!!! tip "Pro-tip"
    You can also just provide the commit SHA in one of the following formats to link it:
    
    - `:commit` For commits within the same repository
    - `:user@:commit` For commits of User `:user`
    - `:user/:reopo@:commit` For commits of User `:user` in repo `:repo`

        https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js/issues/26

## File previews
When you link to a section of a file in a specific commit will GitHub show the targeted content in the Issue/Pull request.

Note, that we use an image here to display the result.

## Color preview
When using [inline code](../general#inline-code) can you use a hashtag, followed by a hexadecimal color value (i.e. `#ffffff`) and GitHub will automatically add a small square in the provided color to it.
