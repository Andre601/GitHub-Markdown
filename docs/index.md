# GitHub Markdown
Welcome to the GitHub Markdown site!

The purpose of this page is to list all features regarding the usage of Markdown in GitHub.  
From basic formatting such as **bold** and *italic* to special ones that are part of GitHub Flavourited Markdown (GFM) does this page cover pretty much everything.

## Usage of Markdown
Markdown can be used on multiple places, including but not limited to:

- Markdown files (i.e. `README.md`)
- Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Commit Comments and Releases
- Wiki Pages

## Pages
Since not all features are used everywhere is the site split up into different categories to cover them as good as possible.

### General
Main Markdown formatting that can be used across GitHub.

[:octicons-markdown-16: General](general){: .md-button }

### Issues, Pull requests and Discussions
Unique formatting options that can only be used in Issues, Pull requests and Discussions.  
This may also include Comments on Commits and Releases but was not tested.

[:octicons-issue-opened-16: Issues, :octicons-git-pull-request-16: Pull requests and :octicons-comment-discussion-16: Discussions](issues-pull-requests){: .md-button }

### Wiki
Unique formatting options that can only be used in Wikis.

[:octicons-book-16: Wiki](wiki){: .md-button }

## Note about this site and styling
This page uses [MkDocs] together with the [PyMdown extensions].  
PyMdown extensions provides certain features that help us to emulate some of GitHub's features like task lists. That said is the style often not the same so it may look different to what GitHub offers. If the style or behaviour is different on GitHub will we mention it.
